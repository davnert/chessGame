        1 square otherwise
    - diagonal to capture square if capture is available
      or if there is an an passant available
    - can change piece type if promoted


Queen: 
    - can move horisontal, diagonal, and verticalin any, to  any square, if possible.

King: 
    can move to all adjacent squares if not putting itself in check or if the square is available. so it can move diagonaly, vertical and horisontal but only one square at a time. can capture in any direction

bishop:
    Can only move diagonaly to any square of the diagonal if possible

knight:
    moves like an L in the availavble directions.
    1 or 2 squares either horisontal or vertical and then 
    and then 2 or 1 squares either vertivcal or horisontal.


Every piece besides the queen can be pinned to queen but
the pin works in a way that if the piece move to any availabe square, it will put its own king in check.
